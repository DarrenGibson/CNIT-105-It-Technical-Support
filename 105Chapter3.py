# Chapter 3  Chapter Summary 

'''

User support staff are frequently assigned technical writing tasks to produce brochures,
flyers, newsletters, handouts, traning aids, user guides, computer manuals, online help
files, email, chat and text messages, webpages,, proposals, memos, operating procudues
documents, and troubleshooting guides.

The goal of technical weiting is to produce documents and messafes that effectively and 
efficiantly communicate information needed by the reader.

A technical writing task begins by definjing the characteristics of the targat audience
including their bacground and reading level. Eavh document shouls be planned with 
a cleat understaning of what the writer wants the reader to be able to do after 
reeading it

In technical documents , short words and sentences are preferable to long ones,. INformation 
should be organized so it is easy to locate. The pourpose of a documnet and its intended 
audience should be clearly stated so each reader can decide at the beginning whether to read 
the document

The process of technical writing unckudes prganizing ideas and topocs into an outline and 
expanding the oputline into a first draft. Edit passes through a document are intended to 
aliminate extra wordds, tighten rose, and checl for format consistency and technical 
accuracy. A review bt another person is a useful check to improve a document before the funal revision.

The layout of a document should help a reader inderstand the otrganication, know 
what is important, and be aware  when transitions between topics occur. Formatting 
should be used consistantly to enhance the information presented, not detract
from it.

Successful technical writers use strategues such as analogies, repetion, consistent word 
use, and parallel structure ro help the audience understand the material.

Common problems ro avoid in technical documents include clutter, inappropriate 
rtpefaces, gender references, unclear referents, and passive voice. Other common 
problems are nominalization, wordiness, jargon, undefined acronyms and initialisms, 
idioms, and dangling phrases. 

Seceral software tools, including an optline tool, spell checker, thesaurus, grammar
checker, and destop publishing features, are available to help technical writers produce
well-organized, accurate, and lprofessional-looking documents. 

Writers use four criteria-content, organization, format and mechanics-to evaluate
a technical document.
